Pirate Intelligent Agent
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning to train an intelligent agent to navigate a maze. Using Q-learning, the agent explores the environment, updates a Q-table based on rewards, and learns optimal navigation strategies. The project showcases my ability to implement machine learning techniques and reinforcement learning principles in a structured problem-solving approach.

Work Completed
For this project, I was provided with a base Jupyter Notebook containing the general framework for implementing a reinforcement learning agent. The given code included an environment setup, basic movement mechanics, and a template for the Q-learning process. I expanded upon this by refining the Q-learning algorithm, adjusting reward structures, and improving the training process to optimize the agent’s performance. Additionally, I modified the visualization and evaluation methods to better track the learning progress and ensure the agent successfully reaches its goal.

Computer Science Connections
Role of Computer Scientists
Computer scientists design, develop, and optimize algorithms that solve complex problems across various industries. Their work enables advancements in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, software development, and data science. In this project, I applied reinforcement learning techniques, which are widely used in robotics, game AI, and autonomous systems, demonstrating how computer science principles can be leveraged to create intelligent agents.

Problem-Solving Approach
As a computer scientist, my approach to problem-solving involves breaking down complex tasks into manageable components, implementing algorithms iteratively, and testing solutions to refine performance. In this project, I followed an incremental development process—starting with a basic Q-learning framework, experimenting with different hyperparameters, and analyzing the agent’s performance to make data-driven improvements.

Ethical Responsibilities
Ethical considerations in artificial intelligence and reinforcement learning include ensuring fairness, transparency, and reliability of models. It is crucial to avoid biased training data and unintended consequences when deploying AI systems in real-world applications. Additionally, as a computer scientist, I have a responsibility to develop software that prioritizes user safety and aligns with organizational values. While this project is a controlled simulation, the principles of responsible AI development, including proper testing and ethical considerations, remain essential.
